# Unit-05-Third-Party-APIs-Homework-Work-Day-Scheduler

Here is a daily planner with the current date displayed at the header.
(date changes depending on the current date)

The planner is from 9am to 5pm which interact with the user by showing
the user the hours that have past in (grey) the current hour in (red) and future hours in (green).

The user can type in events into each block and save them by clicking the save button(saved to local storage), so the the page is refreshed and the input is not removed.
